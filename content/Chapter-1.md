title: Chapter 1-Random Kid

"Haaa..." a boy yawned as he complained about being tired. They were all in a train back to the *Anarchist Platform* to continue their duties.

They all had one thing in common. None of them gave a shit about it.

Everyone had the same expression plastered on their face, it said "Screw this shit! I wanna go back damnit!". Not the expression you would want to see on the faces of the people who should, or at least supposed to protect the masses.

Among them was a young man, with scars on his face which signified that this wasn't on his first trip to hell. He was Second Lieutenant Jim Watkins or "Icicle's" as people liked to call him. Clearly he was the only one who seemed to be serious about the things happening in the Platform.

The train came to a halt and the sudden stop made everyone except Jim crash into each other. Jim stood up and yelled "Alright men! It's patrol time!"

As Jim got down the train everyone followed him both reluctantly and hesitantly.

"Second Lieutenant Jim, I have some news" Jim was greeted by a guy so slender that if you sighed you could argue that it could blow him into the wind.

"What news? You gaining weight?" Jim scoffed.

"I have gained a total of 2.7 kilograms this month," the man smiled "But there is a bigger issue at hand..." he sighed.

"Bigger issue?" Jim raised his eyebrow.

"Apparently two people have initiated dominion in close proximity, they have had been fighting for three hours straight but it seems to have calmed down. We need to-"

"Say no more..." Jim interrupted him and took out his gun from utility belt. The gun install turned fiery red and flames started coming out the guns body.

The next moment, Jim wasn't to be seen.

*I didn't even tell him the location yet...*. The man thought.

Jim walked through the fog, his fiery gun illuminating the way, he saw battle marks along the ground. The sight of the ground told Jim the intensity of the battle taht had taken place. It was brutal.

*Must have been one hell of a fight.* He thought.

He navigated the ground which cried out complaining about the fight that had taken place, he advanced cautiously to catch incoming adversaries.

Soon enough he saw something, the shadow of a person lying on the ground passed out. He cautiously made his way through the dust.

*Caught you...* He thought as he slowly advanced towards the passed out person.

He quickly dashed towards the person pointing towards him, instantly he lowered his gun.

It was a kid, in his teens lying down with his scarred chest facing upwards, a katana stood upright near his head. Someone had tried to kill him. His injuries were serious.

What was a kid doing in this fight? The Anarchist Platform was a place to dump human trash that only knew violence, it was an absolute abomination, the very core of inhumanity. The kid was in the middle of it, how? How did this innocent kid end up in this hellhole five hundred feet underground?

Jim came to his senses and quickly checked the kid's pulse. He was still kicking.

*What are you made of kid?*

"Huh..." the boy groaned as he got up, everyone in the room immediately noticed his conciousness.

*Coma again?* He thought. Somehow the kid knew that he had been in coma.

"You're awake! Thank god..." the nurse sighed in relief.

*Huh? Why am I here?* The boy looked around, seemingly confused.

"Where am I?" he asked.

"You're in the safe hands of the E.P.O now..." the nurse said.

*E.P.O? Did she just say E.P.O? What?!*

The boy put his hands on face. *I finally got a lead on him and then this happens...*

"Are you... Okay?" the nurse asked.

*I am everything but okay.* He slowly lowered his palm revealing only his left eye on his face. Instantly his iris became crimson red.

"Your eye's..."

The boy got up and instantly started walking towards the room. The nurse tried to stop him.

"Hey! You haven't recovered yet!"

She was answered by a quick slap on her hand. The force was enough to make her hands red and she grasped her hand tightly.

He made his way to the door where the guards tried to stop him. They were met with a fierce blow to the stomach. The raw strength of the punch
